## Migration of application from local to cloud

Certainly! Let's break down the process of moving an application to **Microsoft Azure** into a step-by-step flow. This will help you understand the journey and ensure a smooth transition:

1. **Discover**:
    - **Catalog your software and workloads**: Begin by identifying all the components of your application, including servers, databases, and dependencies.
    - **Assess**: Categorize these applications and workloads. Understand their interdependencies and determine which entities need to be migrated together.
    - **Target**: Identify the destination (or destinations) within Azure for each workload. Consider factors like scalability, performance, and cost.
    - **Azure Migrate**: Use this tool to assess on-premises workloads for migration to AzureÂ¹.

2. **Migrate**:
    - **Application Migration**:
        - **Azure App Service Migration Assistant**: If you have web workloads, this tool simplifies the migration of your web apps to Azure with minimal or no code changes.
        - **Data Migration Assistant**: For databases, use this tool to migrate schema and data, along with other server objects (such as logins, SQL Server Agent jobs, and SSIS packages).
        - **Azure Database Migration Service**: This service helps you move databases to Azure efficiently.
    - **Schema and Data Migration**: Ensure that your application schema and data are migrated successfully.
    - **Server Objects**: Migrate any other server objects that your application depends on.

3. **Post-Migration**:
    - **Fix Breaking Changes**: Address any issues reported during assessment. Make necessary fixes to ensure a smooth transition.
    - **Functional Testing**: Conduct functional tests to verify that the application behaves as expected.
    - **Performance Optimization**: Address any performance issues encountered during testing.

4. **Optimize**:
    - **Continuous Evaluation**: Regularly evaluate your application's performance and cost.
    - **Fine-Tune Performance**: Optimize your resources, configurations, and settings.
    - **Leverage Cloud Native Services**: Explore Azure's native services to enhance business insights and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO)Â¹.

Remember, this journey involves collaboration between your development, operations, and cloud teams. By following these steps, you'll be well on your way to successfully migrating your application to Azure! ðŸš€
